To launch Sysgen (Matlab 2014b!)
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2014.4/bin/sysgen
sysgen now launches 2016.2
15 Oct trying to test Tone detect firmware. Interface through bram to PS works, however values are all zeros. Either address is stuck at zero of data is stuck at zero.
Think may be due to audio being not set so still being 0
Default frequency should be 2'b01

uint32 Values2Recover
Bits 15:0 give number of samples to recover
Bits 17:16 give the signal to recover stream of uint32
i) 0 - Recover Filterred (demodulated) signal in lowest 18 bits
ii) 1 - Recover Audio Out to Speaker in bits 15:0 and BTAudio from headset mic in bits 31:16
iii) 2 Recover Amplitude and phase of Start tones
iv) 3 Recover Amplitude and phase of Stop tones

Amp Phase determination of tones OK now except for StartA - probably because was doing sign extension of division of the increment by 4.
Need to test (21/1/17)
OK

NEED TO TRY SHIFTING TONE increments by 1 each way to see if we can get the phase drift over ~64ms better
27/1 decreased by 1 start tone increments to:
CONSTANT	StrtToneAInc,			9E
CONSTANT	StrtToneBInc,			68
CONSTANT	StopToneAInc,			59 (had mistakenly put 5B for Stopstrong2 etc)
CONSTANT	StopToneBInc,			77

Need to calculate phase differentials between samples (each 8ms). If below ~30 in absolute for >~9 8ms periods then tone has been detected.

Monitor the following values:
StarttoneAmp (value communicated from tone detect to the DSP need to adjust if different from ~15)
adcgain_ave_peak (bits 0-7 ADC peak value - should be less than 128, bits 8-15 mean level - need to calibrate, bits 19-16 ADC PGA gain setting )
demodsignallevel (bits 8-31 of AveSignal accumulated in the DSPpico  and AGCvalue in bits 0-7)
txaudiolevel (16bits of accumulated AMP value sent to the SSB transmitter - should be well below 65436, but much larger than say 1000)
NEED TO ADD DSP AGC level (AGCvalue)

Streamed values:
Channel 0 18bit Demod value (after multiplexer but only BOTTOM 16 bits are used by the DSP pico - so value should not exceed 32768), Then ADC Gain (4 bits), then AGC value (8 bits)
Channel 1 Lower 16bits audio out to speaker (should keep below 32768), upper 16 bits BT audio in from BT mic.

Channel 6 - 2 words with ADC data in lower 14 bits (so shouldn't exceed 8k).
Suggest:
Channel 7 - 4 bytes containing top 8 bits before AGC MUX, top 8 bits after AGC mux, top 8 bits after filter then depending on TX_High RX:AudioMSB (to DAC)/TX: AMP to SSB modulator


Need to check we are getting full dynamic range of ADC - seem to be replacing top 2 bits with sign extended bits of lowest 14 bits.
Seems OK, we have granularity of 1 bit and ADC scaling seems to keep values within +/-2^13 (check ch 6 again with strong signal)
Need to add a signal source (18 bit * 16k)RAM and configurable MUX (use values2recover register)

After doing testing of Audiolevels, normally have only about a pk-pk signal in the MSB of the order of 2, but goes up to about 30 pk-pk with the strong signal (which sounded saturated). The DAC, which is 14bits seems only to be getting about 7 bits of useful data in normal operation, so can afford to get more level from demod mux (go for higher target in AGC?), but clipping is coming from the audio amp, so reduce the volume setting or else reduce the potentiometer ratio.
Need to do signal level measurements again on channel 7 to get proper low signal readings (suspect previous values)
Done - seems as expected now - need to adjust target levels

To work with hello world program in SDK - recover the compiled pico programs for the keypad and userpico from the N3Sygenold directory in TE0722rebuild directory.
18/4/17 need to dropADC target level slightly for RX and slightly for TX
Drop TX signal after AGC and check for saturation!
Need to drop DSPpico target level for TX a factor 2 (RX is OK!?).

Worth trying to increase R75 to 1Mohm with a cap to smooth?
Should sort out low impedance drive of volume control of AD7052A

Following June 2017 BCRC conference
Need to get start tone debug information to work out why it does not activate.
Streaming channel 2 recovers start tone amps in top 16 bits and phase in lower 16 bits. Write Pyserial utility.

Write a loop that sends name : value pairs at ~2Hz of 
 ADC average value= %d \n\r",(RegisterData % 65536)/256);
		ADC peak value
		ADC average value
		ADC Gain
		Demod signal level (24 bit signed)
		AGCvalue 
		
		TX Audio level (average of AMP)

Need to completely overhall the AGC. Keep Integrations over 32ms (256 values)  and 512ms (accumulate 16 off 32ms accumulations but check for saturation). There will be a max level for 32ms, if exceeded, the AGCvalue will be increased by 1, if it is exceeded by ~1.19 it will be increased again by 1 if greater than threshold x 1.4, increase again if more than 1.68 x threshold, increase again if more than twice, etc all the way up to X4. If 512ms average less than low threshold then decrease AGC by 1.

Accumulate absvalue of top 8 bits over 256 values into 16 bit accumulator.

Say Maxthreshold=16000, ie 64 in USB
after accumulating again X16, low threshold 32? 
Variation between max and mean is about 16, between max and min means of ~100ms ratio is about 34
(if less than 50 for 2 succesive periods then drop by 1)??????? - maybe not necessary??

pauses in speech are 300-500ms
in pause, mean value is about 34 times smaller than peak (when averaged over 32ms)

Transmission tests show strength to be all over the place. AGCvalue varied from 115 with TXaudio level around 5000/6000 and TXaudio level of 1500
seems to be error in setting AGCvalue at 64! - think corrected need to re-compile DSPpico

Corrected various errors!

Now 512ms sum = 66
32ms sum=3 or 4

on TX more fluctuation
512ms 35-70
32ms 0-4

Now more stable, but maybe need to extend low time constant beyond 512ms??
